Written in Python 3.7

### Description
Qomui (Qt OpenVPN Management UI) is an easy-to-use OpenVPN Gui for GNU/Linux with some unique features such as provider-independent support for double-hop connections. Qomui supports multiple providers with added convenience when using AirVPN, PIA, ProtonVPN, Windscribe or Mullvad. 

### Features
- should work with all VPN providers that offer OpenVPN config files
- automatic download function for Mullvad, Private Internet Access, Windscribe, ProtonVPN and AirVPN 
- support for OpenVPN over SSL and SSH for AirVPN and OpenVPN over SSL for Windscribe (Stealth Mode)
- allows double-hop VPN connections (VPN chains) between different providers
- gui written in PyQt including option to minimize application to system tray 
- security-conscious separation of the gui and a D-Bus service that handles commands that require root privileges
- protection against DNS leaks/ipv6 leaks
- iptables-based, configurable firewall that blocks all outgoing network traffic in case the VPN connection breaks down
- allow applications to bypass the VPN tunnel - to watch Netflix for example
- alternatively: 
- experimental support for WireGuard
- command-line interface
- automatic weekly updates of server configurations for supported providers - experimental

### Screenshots
Screenshots were taken on Arch Linux/Plasma Arc Dark Theme - Qomui will adapt to your theme.<br/>

### Dependencies/Requirements
- Qomui should work on any GNU/Linux distribution 
- python (>=3.5)
- python-pyqt5, python-dbus, and python-dbus.mainloop.pyqt5
- Additional python packages: psutil, requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, pexpect
- openvpn, dnsutils and stunnel
- geoip and geoip-database (optional: to identify server locations)
- dnsmasq, libcgroup, libcgroup-tools, iptables >= 1.6 (optional: required for bypassing OpenVPN)
- wireguard-tools, openresolv (optional: wireguard)

### Installation

#### Ubuntu

Download and install [DEB-Package](https://github.com/corrad1nho/qomui/releases/download/v0.7.0/qomui-0.7.0-amd64.deb)

#### Fedora

Download and install [RPM-Package](https://github.com/corrad1nho/qomui/releases/download/v0.7.0/qomui-0.7.0-1.x86_64.rpm)

#### Arch

Qomui is available on the AUR:

```
yaourt -S qomui
```

#### Source

Make sure all dependencies are installed - be aware that depending on your distribution package names may vary!

I recommend downloading and extracting the latest release and installing via:
```
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

If your adventurous:
```
git clone https://github.com/corrad1nho/qomui.git
cd ./qomui
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Usage
Qomui contains two components: qomui-gui and qomui-service (and qomui-cli: see below). The latter exposes methods via D-Bus and can be controlled via systemd (alternatively you can start it with "sudo qomui-service" - this is not recommended). Be aware that if you choose to activate the firewall and enable qomui-service all internet connectivity will be blocked as long as no OpenVPN/WireGuard connection has been established whether or not the gui is running. Alternatively, the "Edit firewall" dialog in the options tab offers a setting to enable/disable the firewall if you start/quit the gui. You can also add custom iptables rules there. 

Current configurations for AirVPN, Mullvad, ProtonVPN, PIA and Windscribe can be automatically downloaded via the provider tab. For all other providers you can conveniently add a config file folder. Qomui will automatically resolve host names, determine the location of servers (using geoip-database) and save your username and password (in a file readable only by root). 

Once you added server configurations, you can browse and filter them in the server tab. Furthermore, you can mark servers as favourites and connect to one of them randomly. To see a list of all favourited servers click on the star in the upper right. 

### Double-Hop
To create a "double-hop" simply choose a first server via the "hop"-button before connecting to the second one. You can mix connections to different providers. However, the double-hop feature does not support OpenVPN over SSL/SSH and WireGuard. Also be aware that depending on your choice of servers this feature may drastically reduce the speed of your internet connection and increase your ping. In any case, you will likely have to sacrifice some bandwith. In my opinion, the added benefits of increased privacy, being able to use different providers as entry and exit node and making it more difficult to be tracked are worth it, though. This feature was inspired by suggestions to simply run a second instance of OpenVPN in a virtual machine to create a double-hop. If that is possible, it should be possible to do the same by manipulating the routing table without the need to fire up a VM. Invaluable resources on the topic were [this discussion on the Openvpn forum](https://forums.openvpn.net/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=7483) and [this github repository](https://github.com/TomAshley303/VPN-Chain). 

### Bypass OpenVPN
Qomui includes the option to allow applications such as web browsers to bypass an existing OpenVPN tunnel. This feature is fully compatible with Qomui's firewall activated and double-hop connections. When activated, you can either add and launch applications via the respective tab or via console by issuing your command the following way:

```
cgexec -g net_cls:bypass_qomui $yourcommand
```
The idea is taken from [this post on severfault.com](https://serverfault.com/questions/669430/how-to-bypass-openvpn-per-application/761780#761780). Essentially, running an application outside the OpenVPN tunnel works by putting it in a network control group. This allows classifying and identifying network packets from processes in this cgroup in order to route them differently. Be aware that the implementation of this feature is still experimental. 

The bypass feature also allows you to open a second OpenVPN tunnel (this does currently not work with WireGuard). You can choose any of your starred servers from a drop-down menu in the bypass tab. OpenVPN in bypass mode is currently limited to ipv4 to prevent leaks. 

### WireGuard
You can add WireGuard config files from any provider as easily as OpenVPN files. WireGuard configs for Mullvad are now downloaded automatically alongside their OpenVPN configs as long as WireGuard is installed. If you choose to manually import WireGuard config files, Qomui will automatically recognize the type of file. As of now, WireGuard will not be installed automatically with DEB and RPM packages. You can find the official installation guidelines for different distributions [here](https://www.wireguard.com/install/).

### Cli
The cli interface is still experimental and missing some features, e.g. automatic reconnects. Avoid using the cli and the Gui concurrently. 

#### Example usage

Add config files:
```
qomui-cli -a $provider
```
Connect to a server:
```
qomui-cli -c $server
```
Activate options (e.g. firewall):
```
qomui-cli -e firewall
```
List and filter available servers:
```
qomui-cli -l Airvpn "United States"
```
To see all other available options:
```
qomui-cli --help
```

### About this project
Qomui has been my first ever programming experience and a practical challenge for myself to learn a bit of Python. At this stage, Qomui is a beta release at best. So, don't expect it to run flawlessly even though I test every release extensively on different machines. My resources are limited, though. Hence, I'd appreciate any feedback, bug reports and suggestions for new features.
